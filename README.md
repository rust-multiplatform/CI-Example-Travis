# Rust Multi-Platform CI Example for Travis

This repository contains the required files to build your [Rust-Multiplatform] project on [Travis].

## How to use this repository?

To build your project (clone or fork of [Rust-Multiplatform]) and simply add the `.travis.yml` folder to your project folder following whatever method (copy, init-script, submodule, subtree, etc.) you deem best.

> ⚠️ Please note that you have to register at [Travis] and activate your project before builds will happen.

## Compatibility note

This configuration is working with the [Base-Project-Template].  
Most of our projects _should_ work fine using this configuration, however a few may require additional dependencies and/or setups.
Refer to your clone/fork of [Rust-Multiplatform] for further information on what may need to be added.
